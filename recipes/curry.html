    <h2>Japanese Curry with Rice. Serves 6-8. Cook Time ~2.5 hrs</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to make this dish after playing my favorite game
      <em>Persona 5</em>. It is a hearty dish, not too spicy with a hint of
      sweetness. It is the perfect food to dish out with a gathering of family
      or friends, or store in the refridgerator to eat over a couple days!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Curry Mix (I'm using Golden Curry medium hot, I've found the spice level
        isn't much different from extra hot but with more flavor)
      </li>
      <li>2 Large onions</li>
      <li>3 large carrots</li>
      <li>4-5 potatoes</li>
      <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>32 oz chicken stock (or broth)</li>
      <li>2 sweet apples</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>soy sauce</li>
      <li>rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make Rice!</li>
      <li>
        Prepare the ingredients. Peel the onions, cut them in half, and lay each
        half flat and cut the onion (hot dog style) into long thin strips. Peel
        the carrots and cut them into bite sized chunks. Peel the potatoes and
        cut them into larger chunks (2 bites) and soak in water to remove
        starch. Peel the apples. Finally, cut the chicken into bite sized pieces
        and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grab a large pot! Coat the bottom in oil and sauttee the onions. Once
        the onions are soft and golden brown, add the chicken, garlic, and
        ginger. Stir well and cook the chicken through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken stock and the carrots and cook on medium heat. Once it
        begins to simmer, remove the potatoes from the water and add them. Also
        add honey, a splash of soy sauce, and grate the apples into the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue boiling until the potatoes are easy to split with a fork or
        chopsticks. While the pot boils, scrape off any scum or chicken fat on
        the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Use a laddle to stir in a few blocks of curry mix at
        a time with a pair of chopsticks. Keep adding curry until your desired
        consistency, mix well after each block is dissolved. Make sure to taste!
        Add more soy sauce for saltiness and more honey for sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>Serve over rice! Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
