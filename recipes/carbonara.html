    <h2>Creamy Lenguine Carbonara. Serves 3-4, Cook Time ~1 hr</h2>
    <p>
      I always loved my dads sphaggheti carbonara, but over the years I have
      made modifications that suit my taste. My pasta uses thicker lenguine
      noodles and a cream sauce rather than an olive oil sauce. This is a
      quick, easy, comfy dish!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lbs bacon or prosciutto</li>
      <li>1 large onion diced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/2 grated parmesean cheese</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>16 oz linguine pasta</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the sauce. Seperate the egg yolks from the whites, in a bowl mix
        the cream, cheese, and egg yolks together.
      </li>
      <li>Begin cooking the lenguine</li>
      <li>
        While the lenguine cooks, work on the bacon. Cut the bacon into small pieces and cook it in a large cast iron skillet
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the bacon is cooked, scoop it out and use a paper towel to damp out
        some of the grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauttee the onions in the skillet with the remaining grease, throw in
        the garlic too. Add the bacon back in. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the noodles are done, strain them and add
        them to the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the cream sauce and stir well, also add in salt and pepper.
        Optionally top with parsely and more parmesean. Enjoy!
